# Blocking ads

No one likes ads. Except, of course, big corps that make a lot of money because of them. Here I will list ad blocking methods for different apps and websites.

## Blocking ads in websites

The best adblocker currently is [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/). Works pretty much flawlessly, even in YouTube. The only website I still see ads with uBlock Origin installed is Twitch. Also works for Firefox Mobile on Android.

uBlock Origin is not availiable for Google Chrome, as of March 3rd, 2025, due to [Manifest v3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3), Google's latest attempt at "improving the privacy, security and performance" of extensions.

Because of that,  I would advise you to at least try the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) browser, or any fork of Firefox.

As an alternative for those who want to stay on Chromium based browsers, [Brave](https://brave.com) blocks pretty much all ads too, and there's no need to install any adblockers on Brave, since it blocks ads by default. Brave also works in iOS devices, since it doesn't need an extension to block ads.

## Blocking ads in YouTube mobile app

If you have an Android device, your best bet is [ReVanced](https://revanced.app/). It doesn't only block the ads in the YouTube mobile app, but also ads a lot of nice customization options to it. And did I mention that YouTube is not the only app that can be patched with ReVanced? Yes, it removes ads and/or adds customization options for Reddit, Instagram, and many others apps.
This one might be a little complicated, but worth it in the end.
You will probably need tutorials for ReVanced if you have never used it before. So, here's a few useful links:

## Blocking ads in Spotify mobile app (Android only!)

Tired of "Want a break from the ads?" And don't wanna spend money on Spotify premium?
