# Prism Launcher Tutorial

[Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) is a Minecraft Launcher that allows you to have many instances of Minecraft Java Edition. Each instance can be a differrent Minecraft version, have different modloaders and mods, different world saves, different texture packs, you get the point. I would highly suggest everyone to use this launcher instead of the original launcher.

However, there are a few things that new users might need help with when using Prism. That's why I created this tutorial. From the basics to some nice tips and tricks.

## Installing Prism Launcher

To install Prism Launcher, go to https://prismlauncher.org/ and click download.

It will most likely select your OS automatically, but if it doesn't, just select it manually.
In my case, since I'm using Windows, I'll just click ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad9d7062-4102-48c6-a9a6-b0fcd6541bf8).

When the download is complete, just run the executable file.
