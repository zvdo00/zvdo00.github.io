# Prism Launcher Tutorial

[Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) is a Minecraft Launcher that allows you to have many instances of Minecraft Java Edition. Each instance can be a differrent Minecraft version, have different modloaders and mods, different world saves, different texture packs, you get the point. I would highly suggest everyone to use this launcher instead of the original launcher.

However, there are a few things that new users might need help with when using Prism. That's why I created this tutorial.
